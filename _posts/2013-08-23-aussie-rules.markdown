Good news for our Australian friends\: announcing two new payment options for AUD.

<!--more-->

We’ve been testing [Pin Payments](https://pin.net.au) for the last few months as an additional payment option to PayPal&mdash;this is now live for everyone.

And coincidentally, today [Stripe](https://stripe.com) announced its AUD beta is open for those with an invite. Don’t have one yet? [Let us know](mailto:support@tito.io) we might be able to help :)

Have yourselves a great weekend!
