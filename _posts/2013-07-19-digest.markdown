Inbox 3000? We might be able to help&hellip;

We’ve added a digest email to give you a daily summary of your ticket registrations.

By default, this has been switched on so if you sold any tickets today, you’ll be receiving your first digest email tomorrow.

If you’d like to stop individual notifications of each ticket sale, or indeed, stop receiving emails altogether, just click on your profile in the header and modify your settings.

Have yourseves a wonderful weekend.
