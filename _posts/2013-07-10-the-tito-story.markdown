It's a sunny afternoon in Dublin. As sunny, if not more, than I can remember. Cillian got burned in the sun at the weekend. After two years, David is still asking me how to import a database. The sun has obviously gone to his head. I don't mind. It's gone to mine too. I'm sweltering.

What a great day to ship the Tito blog.

This is a perfect place to post announcements, feature updates, guides, thoughts, and things that we think you'll be interested in.

We're at the tip of a public release, and this is the first step. Tito has come a long way since the first line of code, written on a Ryanair flight in April 2011.

[Eamo](http://twitter.com/eamonleonard) and I were about to launch the [second Funconf](http://2011.funconf.com), and I was insisting on "writing my own" ticket site. I wanted a smooth, consistent ticket purchasing experience for Funconf attendees, and I wanted a way to manage the attendees that didn't make me panic.

Simple as it was, the Funconf sale went well, and Funconf went on to generate [its own kind of mythology](http://freelancing-gods.com/posts/funconf). After a few cautious iterations, the first event to make the leap of faith to use Tito for a real event was one that I had the pleasure to attend and speak at: [Northern Lights in Aberdeen](http://northern-lights.herokuapp.com/).
