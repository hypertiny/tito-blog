The [Great British Node Conference](https://tito.io/nodeuk/great-british-node-conference) goes on sale today, so what better day to do a roundup of some interesting events on Tito.

Over 500 tickets have been sold accross 40 events in the last week on Tito, among them some fantastic events.

[Distill](http://distill.engineyard.com/), [Engine Yard](http://www.engineyard.com)'s first developer conference was last week, and [it sounds](https://twitter.com/distill) like it was a great show.

We've also been hearing [great things](https://twitter.com/rjs/status/356112005767245824) about [Asymco Airshow](http://airshow.asymco.com/), Horace Dediu's on-tour storytelling workshop. There have been a few iterations already, and the next one is in New York on the 25th September. Horace was one of the first people on the planet to use Tito for a big event, and it's awesome to see his events empire growing!

Taking place in Cardiff this week is our Founding Customer [Zach Inglis](https://twitter.com/zachinglis)'s [HybridConf](http://hybridconf.net/), with a lineup just bursting with smart, opinionated, influential folks. Expect a great many nuggets of inspiration.

One of our coolest stats of late is the breadth of top-level web technology conferences *eg. $techConf* that are hosted on Tito: [JSconf](http://2013.jsconf.us) (and [JSConf.eu](http://2013.jsconf.eu)), [CSSConf](http://cssconf.com/) (and [CSSConf.eu](http://2013.cssconf.eu)), [Sass Conf](http://sassconf.com/), [nodeconf](http://www.nodeconf.com/) (and [Nodeconf EU](http://www.nodeconfeu.com/)), [Ruby Conf](http://rubyconf.com) (and, uh [Nordic Ruby](http://nordicruby.com)? ... or perhaps [Scottish Ruby Conference](http://2013.scottishrubyconference.com)). Finally, the world's first [Go Conference, GopherCon](http://www.gophercon.com/) is on next April, and tickets are of course [on sale on Tito](https://tito.io/gophercon/gophercon-2014).

Some other notable conferences that look cool to me are [BlendConf](http://www.blendconf.com/) in Charlotte, North Carolina, [LeanConf 2013](http://www.leanconf.co.uk/) in Manchester, England and [Front-end London One-Day](https://tito.io/front-end-london/one-day), which looks like a great format for meetups wanting to level up to mini-conference status.

Finally, a shout-out to [So Coded](http://socoded.com/) in Hamburg, where I'll be making my one and only speaking appearance of the year. You can also hear me talking about whisky and conferences on the first episode of [Peated.io](http://peated.io/1/) and you can hear me talking about Tito and designing conferences on [The Giant Robots Podcast](http://learn.thoughtbot.com/giantrobots/61).
