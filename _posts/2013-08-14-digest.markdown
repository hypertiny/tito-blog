We’re thrilled to introduce you to a new publication from our friends at Viewport Industries.

Tito customers for their [Insites](https://tito.io/viewport-industries) events, [Viewport Industries](http://viewportindustries.com/) are [Keir Whitaker](http://twitter.com/keirwhitaker) and [Elliot Jay Stocks](http://twitter.com/elliotjaystocks). Time after time, these two redefine what it means to work on a side-project and we were super happy to help support Digest.

> Digest is an attempt to bring the culture we’ve found on our travels around the globe to the printed page. We aim to provide a seasonal dose of inspiration for the discerning traveller and a reminder that the world away from our computers is ripe for exploration.

On sale now, Digest is an intellectual and visual treat, and we can’t wait to get our hands on a copy.
