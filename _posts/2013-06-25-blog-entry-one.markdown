It's a sunny afternoon in Dublin. As sunny, if not more, than I can remember. Cillian got burned in the sun at the weekend. After two years, David is still asking me how to import a database. The sun has obviously gone to his head. I don't mind. It's gone to mine too. I'm sweltering.

What a great day to ship the Tito blog.

This is a perfect place to post announcements, feature updates, guides, thoughts, and things that we think you'll be interested in.

We're at the tip of a public release, and this is the first step.

The first two real posts will introduce two of our latest Founding Customers, who join a rather pristigious exsting lineup.
