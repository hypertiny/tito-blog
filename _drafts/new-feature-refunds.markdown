Up until this point refunds in Tito has been a little cumbersome. Our new refunds feature makes the process a lot smoother. 

It is a flexible and powerful little tool for you as an organiser to do a multitude of things. You can void individual tickets or entire orders. You can partially refund or fully refund an order. And, if you need, you can do any combination of those things from the one screen.

To issue a refund or void a ticket you can either navigate to the attendee you want to apply the refund or void to. Or you can navigate to an order and do the same thing.

This feature ended up being a particularly tricky one to nail down so that we were all happy with both the range of functionality while reducing complexity. Having to cater for all the varying use cases for this seemingly simple interaction was our biggest challenge but we feel that we've come up with a solution that will make it easy to process refunds and voids in whatever permutation you require.
