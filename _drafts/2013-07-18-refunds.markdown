We're delighted to announce our first new feature here on the blog, and it's a big oneâ€¦

<!--more-->

You can now process refunds for all payment gateways from within Tito. We know some of you have been waiting a while for this one, so thanks for your patience.

We've made this feature as flexible as possible, allowing you to  fully, or partially refund an order or an individual ticket. You can also choose whether or not to void a ticket when refunding, and if so whether to put that ticket back on sale once voided.

Incase you weren't aware, each payment gateway has their own refund conditions, here's a recap:

- [Stripe](http://stripe.com): no time limit
- [PayPal](http://paypal.com): within 60 days of purchase
- [Pin](http://pin.net.au): no time limit, full refunds only

As always, we'd love any feedback you might have, drop us an email at [support@tito.io](mailto:support@tito.io).
